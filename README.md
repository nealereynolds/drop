## Drop the base, base html &amp; sass

This is a loose framework that I use to build my own projects on top of.

It is by no means perfect but is developed from a **very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a short career in the web.** (Read best in the voice of Liam Neeson).

This little guide covers how I like to format & structure my SCSS/CSS & HTML.

Also as with most frameworks it is a collection of bits and pieces created by myself and others, if bits are used they are credited in place.

## HTML

Nesting elements can get messy so I like to comment off my elements with HTML comments as followed.

<div class="class">
</div><!-- //.class -->

### Multiple Classes

If there are load of classes on a HTML element then simply chain the closing comments as followed:

<div class="class second third">
</div><!-- //.class //.second //.third -->

**This can obviously become as confusing as no comments at all if overused so use sparingly.**

## CSS

### Comments

Use comments to block out and explain sections of code, this is particularly useful when using SCSS as code is split across a range of files.

#### Document Heading

Place a file heading comment denoting the name of the file as a quick reference and any additional info such as dependencies or links to code examples or author attribution.

E.g.

/*------------------------------------*\
    $FILENAME
  * @author:
  * @version:
  * @example: 
\*------------------------------------*/

#### Sections

Use comments to break up code sections within a file, as followed:

/*------------------------------------*\
    $SECTION
\*------------------------------------*/

### Naming Conventions

##### Add a space over a property's colon

position: relative;

as opposed to

position:relative;

#### Long Class Names

When you're using a long class name, use hypens to break up the single works e.g.

.large-class-name {}

##### BEM

I'm currently adopting a BEM naming convention so all classes should follow the principle of:

.block {}
.block__element {}
.block--modifier {}

You can read more on this at [B.E.M](http://bem.info/)

### Tabs & Spaces

Personal preference is tabs.

### ID's

To avoid specificity problems, avoid styling off ID's where possible.

## JS Hooks

To avoid a messy overlap of CSS & JS write set hooks for JS either ID's or Classes.
